    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) is widely used for data analysis in Python and it makes the process of working with structured data easier. Pandas combines the efficiency of NumPy (which we saw in [notebook 1](01-numpy-basics.ipynb)) with tools to manipulate and re-structure data and perform aggregations and queries on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will give you a quick introduction to Pandas. Like the earlier notebooks in this series, some of the cells are in question-and-answer format, whilst some contain working code - make sure you think about what these cells are doing whilst working through the notebook.\n",
